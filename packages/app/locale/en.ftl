# Notes:
#
# * Modifier key names do not need to be translated. They cannot be bound to shortcuts in Condict. Ignore them.
# * Ignore notes about historical browser behaviour. Only modern Chromium matters.
# * Only translate keys that actually need to be translated. If the target language calls it "Home", you don't need to write `[Home] Home`.
# * The spacebar key is given as "Space", not " ". Therefore, match against `[Space]`, not `[ ]`.
# * The default case must be `*[default] {$key}`. The value `{$key}` ensures we never accidentally mess up a legitimate key.
