# IPA input

**This component is not fully functional.**

The [International Phonetic Alphabet][ipa] (IPA) contains many characters that are absent from virtually all keyboards. To facilitate input of such characters, the `<IpaInput>` component can be used to search for IPA characters by phonological property and, in many cases, visual similarity.

The IPA input component uses [`@condict/ipa`](../ipa) as its backing search engine.

(TODO: More documentation.)
