/**
 * A dictionary event.
 *
 * Dictionary events are emitted when resources in the dictionary change. Events
 * encapuslate additions (action == 'create'), updates (action == 'update') and
 * deletions (actions == 'delete'). Dictionary events are fairly high-level, and
 * cannot be used for fine-grained updates. They contain information about what
 * was done and to what resource, but do not contain e.g. changed fields. Events
 * should be used to determine whether the client needs to re-fetch data, not to
 * patch already fetched data.
 *
 * Update events on a child resource do not automatically cause update events on
 * the parent resource. For instance, renaming an inflection table will cause an
 * InflectionTableEvent to be emitted, but *not* a PartOfSpeechEvent on the part
 * of speech that the table is in. A page that shows a part of speech's name and
 * tables should therefore subscribe to updates on the part of speech *and* on
 * inflection table events where partOfSpeechId has the relevant value. This
 * gives the client more flexibility in choosing which updates to subscribe to.
 *
 * Deletions also do *not* propagate downwards. If a part of speech is deleted,
 * no events will be emitted for the deletion of the inflection tables that are
 * contained in that part of speech. This is done for performance reasons, as
 * the deletion of a resource with many children may otherwise require thousands
 * of events (particularly for languages). However, lemma delete events *are*
 * triggered in response to definition edits, as that is the only place where
 * lemmas are created and deleted.
