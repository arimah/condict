   * The `params` parameter of this field contains a number of fields. The most
   * important is `query`, which contains the free text search query. At minimum,
   * a query to this field must include that:
   * 
   * ```graphql
   * query {
   *   search(params: {
   *     # Search for anything matching "foo"
   *     query: "foo"
   *   }) {
   *     ...
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * This field can search through most of the dictionary: lemmas, languages,
   * definitions, and more. The `scope` field specifies the kinds of resources that
   * should be searched:
   * 
   * ```graphql
   * query($query: String!) {
   *   search(params: {
   *     query: $query
   *     # Search only in languages and lemmas
   *     scopes: [SEARCH_LANGUAGES, SEARCH_LEMMAS]
   *   }) {
   *     ...
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * The search parameters can also include filters for other properties, such as
   * associated tags, part of speech or language. Use of these fields implicitly
   * constrains the type to resources with those fields. For example, only lemmas
   * and definitions have tags, so this example will only return results for those
   * resources (despite broader `scopes`):
   * 
   * ```graphql
   * query($query: String!, $tag, TagId!) {
   *   search(params: {
   *     query: $query
   *     scopes: [SEARCH_LANGUAGES, SEARCH_LEMMAS, SEARCH_DEFINITIONS, SEARCH_TAGS]
   *     # Only definitions and lemmas have tags; languages and tags will not be
   *     # present in the result.
   *     withTags: [$tag]
   *   }) {
   *     ...
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * Lastly, searches can match many items, so the results of a search are always
   * paginated. If provided, `page.perPage` cannot exceed 200.
