This directory is a placeholder for GraphQL schema files. The corresponding directory in the build folder (../../../dist) is populated when you run `npm run build`, or more specifically, by `npm run build:copyGraphql`.

The .graphql files that define the schema are contained in [/graphql-schema](../../../../../graphql-schema).
