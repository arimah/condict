"""
An inflection table defines how to inflect words that belong to the table's part
of speech. The table is a true 2-dimensional table, not merely a list of forms.
As such, it can contain any number of rows and columns, and some cells may be
headers. Cells can span multiple rows and columns.

There are two ways to access the contents of an inflection table:

* The `layout` field preserves information about the table's cells, and is used
  to construct the table in its entirety.
* The `inflectedForms` field provides only the table's inflected forms, which
  do not on their own contain any layout information. It is not possible using
  this field alone to determine which inflected form goes where.

"""
A single inflected form. Each form belongs to exactly one table.

An inflected form has an _inflection pattern_, which describes how to construct
the form when applied to a word. Inflection patterns contain placeholders inside
curly brackets, such as `{Plural root}`, which are replaced by the definition's
stems. See `Definition.stems` and `DefinitionStem` for more. The placeholder
`{~}` always refers to the definition's lemma form.

In addition to this, the `deriveLemma` field determines whether the inflected
form, once computed for a word, is added to the dictionary as its own lemma.
This enables the dictionary to list e.g. "birds" as the plural of "bird". This
feature can be disabled or enabled for each individual form.

Finally, every inflected form has a name. Usually inflected form names are
derived from the inflection table's header cells, but the user can also enter
a custom name. The `hasCustomDisplayName` field indicates whether the name was
derived automatically. The display name is used for derived definitions, so the
dictionary can show "birds" as the _plural_ of "bird", not merely a generic
_inflected form of_.
