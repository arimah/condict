As its name suggests, a definition defines a lemma. A definition has a part of
speech, a description, and, optionally, some inflection tables.

A definition's description contains free-form formatted text. Paragraphs, list
items, headings and other things.

A definition's inflection tables must belong to the definition's part of speech.
