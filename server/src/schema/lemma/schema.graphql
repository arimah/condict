"""
A _lemma_ is a word listed in a dictionary. A lemma contains one or more
_definitions_, which, as the name imply, actually define the lemma. The lemma
itself only serves to group definitions.

Lemmas are managed automatically. The dictionary's lemmas are edited indirectly
by changing the definitions contained in them.
