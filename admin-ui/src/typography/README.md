# Typography

Various components related to text layout and appearance.

## BodyText

The `<BodyText>` component is a [styled component][styled-components], which applies text styling intended to make reading more comfortable in larger spans of text. It does _not_ restrict its own dimensions in any way; it only affects text. By default it renders a `<div>`.
