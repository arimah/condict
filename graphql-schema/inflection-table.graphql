"Represents an inflection table ID."
scalar InflectionTableId @id

"""
An inflection table defines how to inflect words that belong to the table's part
of speech. The table is a true 2-dimensional table, not merely a list of forms.
As such, it can contain any number of rows and columns, and some cells may be
headers. Cells can span multiple rows and columns.

To access the contents of an inflection table, query the `layout` field. Through
it, you can read the table's rows and cells to construct the table, fetch the
inflected forms (see `InflectedForm`) that are contained in the table, as well
as query the definitions that use the table layout.

In addition to the current table layout, inflection tables record some historical
layouts. If the layout is altered while it is in use by one or more definitions,
the previous layout is kept, allowing existing definitions to keep using it. Old
layouts are available through the `oldLayouts` field.

Historical layouts are saved for two reasons:

1. Inflected forms may be added to the dictionary (see `InflectedForm`), and
   recalculating new forms for every definition that uses a table is costly.
2. It is exceedingly difficult for the user to predict the effect of altering
   an inflection table across the entire dictionary, especially if the table is
   used by many definitions.

A single inflected form. Each form belongs to exactly one table.

An inflected form has an _inflection pattern_, which describes how to construct
the form when applied to a word. Inflection patterns contain placeholders inside
curly brackets, such as `{Plural root}`, which are replaced by the definition's
stems. See `Definition.stems` and `DefinitionStem` for more.

In addition to this, the `deriveLemma` field determines whether the inflected
form, once computed for a word, is added to the dictionary as its own lemma.
This enables the dictionary to list e.g. "birds" as the plural of "bird". This
feature can be disabled or enabled for each individual form.

Finally, every inflected form has a name. Usually inflected form names are
derived from the inflection table's header cells, but the user can also enter
a custom name. The `hasCustomDisplayName` field indicates whether the name was
derived automatically. The display name is used for derived definitions, so the
dictionary can show "birds" as the _plural_ of "bird", not merely a generic
_inflected form of_.
