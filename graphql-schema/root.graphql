# The root schema contains various essential types and definitions.

"""
Describes a scalar type as containing an ID, and defines what type of resource
the ID refers to. The ID is a numeric value, and is turned into that on the
server. For compatibility with the built-in `ID` type, the server also accepts
string values for these IDs.

The parameter `of` defines the type of resource that the ID refers to. Two IDs
are eqiuvalent in TypeScript if they refer to the same type of resource. If
omitted, it will be set to the scalar type's name, minus the `Id` suffix.

Without this directive, a custom scalar value will be typed as `unknown`.
