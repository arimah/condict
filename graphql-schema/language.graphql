The language is the root of the dictionary. Everything else in the dictionary
belongs, directly or indirectly, to a language. A dictionary can contain any
number of languages.

A language contains:

* Parts of speech (see `PartOfSpeech`), which words can be associated with.
* Lemmas (see `Lemma`), which are basically the words of the dictionary. Each
  lemma can contain any number of definitions (see `Definition`).

In addition, every language has a (unique) name.
