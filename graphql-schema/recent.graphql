  Lists recently changed dictionary items. The results can be sorted by creation
  date or by last update/edit date.

  Recent items do not include every possible type of dictionary resource. If the
  user changes an inflection table, there will not be recent change entries for
  each individual inflected form, but for the table as a whole. Effectively, the
  resources that have recent changes correspond to those for which there exist
  corresponding `add*` and `edit*` mutations.

  The `order` parameter determines the sort order. If omitted or null, defaults
  to MOST_RECENTLY_UPDATED.

  Since a dictionary may contain many items, this field is always paginated. If
  provided, `page.perPage` cannot exceed 100.
